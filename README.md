This is  a recipe list written in React. 

The root parent component is <ListContainer />, which has two stateless child components for adding/editing recipes, the <ChangeForm /> component, and displaying the existing recipes, the <TableList /> component.

The final build can be found in the dist folder, which was bundled with Webpack.

This project has minimal styling using CSS and Bootstrap.

The Node modules themselves are not included, but the dependencies can be found in the package-lock.json file.
